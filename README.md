Icarus is a high-performance caching framework,running on the java platform, that allows you to 
easily cache results of past calculations. The use of annotations makes it easy for you to implement Icarus in your
projects without much effort.

Getting Started
--
You want to straight jump into using *Icarus*? The following section will show you how to 
implement it in to your project correctly.

To add Icarus to your **maven** dependencies following code can be used:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.icarus</groupId>
  <artifactId>icarus-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

When using **gradle** instead, following code can be used:
```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'io.github.icarus:icarus-core:1.0'
}
```
